# Exercise 1.3

Calculate the width of the muon. Plot the energy spectrum of the
electron. Note that you need to choose a MG model where the muon
has a mass (`sm-full`).

## Solution

The solution is produced by the script ex1_3.mg5 through the command:
```
mg5_aMC ex1_3.mg5
```
The script returns as output the width of the muon:
```
  === Results Summary for run: run_01 tag: tag_1 ===

     Width :   3.004e-19 +- 3.608e-22 GeV
     Nb of events :  10000
```
The plots are generated by `madanalysis5` and are available in the file `report.pdf`.
